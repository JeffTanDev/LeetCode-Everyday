### talk about normal distribution
The normal distribution(also known as the Gaussian distribution) is a statistics and probability theory. It refers to a set of number distribute in a shape of bell curve and is symmetrical around its mean.

The normal distribution is defined by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The mean determines the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the data around the mean. In a normal distribution, about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% falls within two standard deviations, and about 99.7% falls within three standard deviations. This is known as the **Empirical Rule** or the 68-95-99.7 rule.

Another important theory is **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**. The CLT states that if you take the sum or average of a large number of independent, identically distributed, random variables, the result will tend to be normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution of the variables. 也可以说：When the sample size increase, the distribution will tent to be normal.
