### talk about normal distribution
The normal distribution(also known as the Gaussian distribution) is a statistics and probability theory. It refers to a set of number distribute in a shape of bell curve and is symmetrical around its mean.

The normal distribution is defined by two parameters: the mean (Œº) and the standard deviation (œÉ). The mean determines the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the data around the mean. In a normal distribution, about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% falls within two standard deviations, and about 99.7% falls within three standard deviations. This is known as the **Empirical Rule** or the 68-95-99.7 rule.

Another important theory is **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**. The CLT states that if you take the sum or average of a large number of independent, identically distributed, random variables, the result will tend to be normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution of the variables. ‰πüÂèØ‰ª•ËØ¥ÔºöWhen the sample size increase, the distribution will tent to be normal.

### Talk about linear regression
Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.  Linear regression helps you figure out how changes in ùëã are associated with changes in ùëå.
For example, if we want to predict a person‚Äôs weight based on their height, linear regression will help us find the best straight line that tells us, "**for every centimeter increase in height, how much will the weight increase?"**

### What id Power Analysis
Power analysis is a way to figure out how many people or samples we need in a study to be sure we can detect an effect if there is one. It helps us plan our studies better so we don‚Äôt miss any real effects.

There are a few key parts to power analysis:
**Effect Size:** This tells us how big the difference we are looking for is. For example, in a drug test, it could be the difference in recovery rates between two groups.
**Significance Level (Alpha):** This is the cutoff for deciding if our results are real or just by chance. It's usually set at 0.05, meaning there's a 5% chance the results are due to random variation.
**Power:** This is the chance that our study will detect a real effect. We usually aim for 80% power, meaning there's an 80% chance of finding a true effect if it exists.
**Sample Size:** This is how many people or samples we need in our study. Power analysis helps us find the right number so our study is accurate.
For example, if we're testing a new medicine, power analysis tells us how many patients we need to include in our study to confidently see if the medicine works.
